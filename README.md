# WeekTwoChallenge_Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for creating a online portfolio is to show of my work to others and employers. I built this project to understand how to style a website and show of some of the skills that I have learned in CSS. The building of this website solves the problem of employers not being able to find my work, contact info, or my gitlab easily. I learned how much CSS can influence a websites looks to make it more appealing.
